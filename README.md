## **This project is the second project in Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree on Udasity**
## **Introduction**
The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "[they're good dogs Brent](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent)." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

WeRateDogs [downloaded their Twitter archive](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170160) and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.
